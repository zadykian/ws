Sets up my development server from code. Ansible runs on the machine itself and installs packages,
Docker, the shell, tmux, the helix editor, claude and [cld](https://github.com/zadykian/cld).
Running it again is safe, and `--check --diff` shows how a machine differs from the repository.

The roles land one pull request at a time; none is here yet.

## A new machine

Install Ubuntu Server 26.04 by hand from its installer, with an SSH key to log in with. Then run
`bootstrap.sh` as root, after `sudo -i` if you log in as the installer's user:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zadykian/ws/main/bootstrap.sh | sh
```

It installs ansible-core and git with apt, clones this repository into `/root/repository/ws`,
installs the Ansible collections of `requirements.yml`, and runs `site.yml`. Then do what stays
by hand, below.

## Running it again

`bootstrap.sh` leaves the clone in `/root/repository/ws` as it is, so pull first:

```sh
git -C /root/repository/ws pull --ff-only
/root/repository/ws/bootstrap.sh
```

Its arguments go to `ansible-playbook`: `--tags NAME` runs the role NAME alone.

## Dry runs

With `--check --diff`, the playbook shows what it would change and changes nothing:

```sh
/root/repository/ws/bootstrap.sh --check --diff
```

On a new machine, that is:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zadykian/ws/main/bootstrap.sh | sh -s -- --check --diff
```

`bootstrap.sh` still installs ansible-core and git, clones the repository and installs the
collections, as the playbook cannot run without them.

## By hand

Secrets are never in this repository. On a new machine, these stay manual:

- `gh auth login` and `gh auth setup-git`;
- the claude login.

## Checks

CI runs yamllint, ansible-lint with its production profile, ShellCheck and shfmt on the shell
scripts, and gitleaks over the whole history. Any finding fails it, warnings included.

CI also runs `bootstrap.sh` in an Ubuntu 26.04 container, without the tasks tagged `systemd`,
which need a booted machine. It runs it twice, and the second run must change nothing.

The hooks in `.githooks` check each commit before it is made. Enable them in a clone, and so in
its worktrees, with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`, as `bootstrap.sh` does in its clone.
Where `~/.config/ws/forbidden-words` exists, a word or phrase a line, they refuse a commit whose
added lines, file names or message hold one. Where gitleaks is installed, they refuse a staged
secret too.

## Pull requests

Pull requests land on `main` by fast-forward only, as the commits CI checked. GitHub's merge
methods are all refused. A comment `/ff` on a pull request pushes its head to `main`
(`.github/workflows/fast-forward.yml`). A pull request that changes `.github/workflows` is pushed
by hand, `git push origin SHA:main`.
